    <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, we may change our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will provide notification to Users of material changes to this Privacy Policy through our Website at least 30 days prior to the change taking effect by posting a notice on our home page, login screens, or by sending you an email notification.
