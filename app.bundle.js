This has caused\nsome users to panic and uninstall the app leading to loss data. I\'m truly very sorry that this happened, it\nis my regret that I let this bug slip through the testing process. This bug was quickly fixed after being reported.\n\nTo prevent further incidents of this kind, future versions of the editor will be bundled with the Android app.\nStarting with the next Android App version (4.0.0), the editor will no longer auto-update separate from the Android app,\nand the Android version will merge with the Build/Editor version. Releases will be first pushed to the beta-track before being released.\n\nOriginally, the auto-update was a great aid in the development process as it allowed quick updates to fix bugs,\nand the Android wrapper app was not seen to undergo much changes. However, now it\'s come to a point where there\nare too many Android app versions, and the editor has to account for disparity between the every Android version\nthat existed prior and the current Editor version.\n\nStarting with the next Android version (4.0.0):\n\n- Editor version = Android version (No more 0.9.x)\n- Editor code will no longer auto-update (locked to a specific Android version)\n- Any IDB (indexedDB) projects created in [Editor v0.1.0 - v0.6.0] MUST be migrated to Android Filesystem as they will no longer be accessible in "4.0.0"\n\nAndroid version (4.0.0) will be released sometime from 3/7/2020 - 3/15/2020\n\n# Update 0.9.18\n\n## Bug fixes\n\n- Fixed uploading non-text files and UTF-8 encoding check\n\n# Update 0.9.17\n\n## Bug fixes\n\n- Fixed text selection
