    <h1 id="terms-of-service">Terms of Service</h1>
    <p>These Terms are a contract between you, the User, and <strong>Leaf Stack Studio</strong> (“we”, “our” or “us”), being the operator(s) and owner(s) of Spck Editor (“App”, “Application”) and spck.io (“Website”, “Site”).</p>
    <h2 id="1-definitions-">1. Definitions.</h2>
    <h3 id="1-1-">1.1.</h3>
    <p>The following defined terms apply in this agreement:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><p><strong>Content</strong>: means the user’s generated digital material which is stored on the user’s computer which can be accessed through the Site or our Services, including but not limited to any and all content, code, features, comments, graphics, fonts or text you may store on the Site.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><strong>Feedback</strong>: means the feedback provided by Users as “Feedback” is defined later in these Terms.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><strong>Services</strong>: the services provided by to you through our Site including any software applications and mobile applications.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><strong>Site</strong>: means spck.io which includes other domains from time to time which direct to spck.io via DNS aliases.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><strong>Terms</strong>: means the terms and conditions set out in this document.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><strong>User</strong>: means the person who uses or access the Services and/or Site including but limited to browsing the Site, editing or creating Content using the Site or Services, or other means of interaction with the Site, our Services or Content.</p>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="1-2-">1.2.</h3>
    <p>Any other defined terms (introduced as such by quotation marks in parentheses) which appear in these Terms will take the meaning ascribed to them.</p>
    <h2 id="2-license-to-use-our-services-">2. License to use our Services.</h2>
    <p>You agree and accept that your use of the Service is entirely at your own risk.</p>
    <p>These Terms will apply for as long as you use the Site and/or the Services. Any part of these Terms that by necessity or implication are to continue after your use of the Site or the Services ends  shall continue in force.</p>
    <p>Our Services are not directed to children younger than 13, and access and use of our Services is only offered to users 13 years of age or older. If you are under 13 years old, please do not use our Services. Any person who uses or provides their personal information to our Services represents that they are 13 years of age or older.</p>
    <h2 id="3-account-terms">3. Account Terms</h2>
    <p>Short version: User Accounts and Organizations have different administrative controls; a human must create your Account; you must be 13 or over; and you may not have more than one free Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure.</p>
    <p>3.1. Account Controls</p>
    <p><strong>Users</strong>: Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your User Account and the Content within it.</p>
    <p>3.2. Account Requirements</p>
    <p>We have a few simple rules for User Accounts on our Services.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by &quot;bots&quot; or other automated methods are not permitted.</li>
    <li>One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account.</li>
    <li>You must be age 13 or older. Spck Editor does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will terminate that User’s Account immediately. If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.</li>
    <li>Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people.</li>
    <li>You may not use our Services in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction. You may not use our Services if you are or are working on behalf of a Specially Designated National (SDN) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions administered by a U.S. government agency.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>3.3. User Account Security</p>
    <p>You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is posted by others who have Accounts under your Account).</li>
    <li>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. We cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.</li>
    <li>You will promptly notify us if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.</li>
    </ul>
