# TypeScript + Vue Template

This is a TypeScript + Vue project template using webpack for Spck Editor Pro. This project template was made with the help of `createapp.dev`.

## Building and Running

Pressing the â–¶ button will call the command `build-dev` in `package.json`.

The task `build-dev` creates a development build of the project and generates:

- `dist/index.html`
- `dist/bundle.js`

When `build-dev` finishes, the preview window will launch.

## Limitations in Android

Due to security restrictions in Android, execute permissions on write-allowed storage is likely forbidden on most stock devices. This prevents some npm scripts from working properly as `npm run` rely on the use of `sh` which requires exec permissions.

The `node` program is also built as a shared library for compatibility with future versions of Android and can only be accessed from the terminal and not `sh`.

For these reasons, using `npm run ...` will not work from the terminal, but entering the command (`webpack --mode development`) directly in the terminal will work.
